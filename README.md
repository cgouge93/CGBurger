# CGBurger
Application created with Node.js, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, and Bootstrap

## Description
This is a simple full stack application which utilizes a database to store user input. 

The user enters the name of a burger in the input box and clicks "Add burger" to add the burger to the database. The burger will also be added to the "to be devoured" column by default.
Users can indicate that they have eaten the burger by clicking the "Eat" button. The devoured column of the database will change to indicate that it has been eaten, and the burger will move to the Devoured column on the application.
